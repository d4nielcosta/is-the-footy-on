# Is the footy on?

This repo contains a single script to check for football games around me and notify me via a Telegram bot.

This project is not mantained. This was developed as a quick solution for a car traffic problem.

Feel free to adapt the project for your own personal projects. For any commercial applications contact me beforehand.

If you have questions give me a shout.
